# Welcome to my website 

## Some of my projects are as follows: 

## PROJECT - 1: 
### <a href='https://arooj1.github.io/ds_salary_proj/' >Data Scientist Salary Predictor (in North America)</a>

<p>The idea is to create a data science project from scratch. The purpose is to predict the expected salary range of a data scientist across North America.
For the project, data is scrapped from the glassdoor website. Around 500 data scientists, jobs data is of USA and 500 of Canada.
Data is cleaned by removing missing salary data and by extracting useful features from it.
The Rain forest regression model predicts salary ~ MAE of 12K and outperforms the linear regression model.
Built a client-facing API using FLASK.</p>

## PROJECT -2:
### <a href="https://arooj1.github.io/time_series_upwork/"> Anomaly Detection </a>
